# IPL Victory Probability Estimator
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The IPL Victory Probability Estimator is a predictive machine learning model designed to estimate the probability of victory for teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). By analyzing historical match data, this project helps cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and developers gain deeper insights into match outcomes in real-time.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that can:

Predict the outcome of IPL matches.

Enhance match analysis using historical data.

Provide an interactive interface for users to simulate match scenarios and see victory probabilities.

ðŸ§  Technologies & Tools
Python: Data preprocessing, modeling, and backend scripting

Jupyter Notebook: For data analysis and model development

Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing

Scikit-learn: Model creation and evaluation

Pickle: Model serialization and saving

Streamlit: Frontend interface for user interaction

Kaggle Dataset: Source of IPL historical match data

ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ“ˆ Victory Probability Prediction based on live match inputs.

ðŸ§® Data-driven analysis using historical data.

ðŸŽ¯ User-friendly interface using Streamlit.

ðŸ“¦ Serialized model for fast and reusable predictions.
